# NGSuggestions

<b>How to use this app?</b>
 
 Suggestions based of current location
 
 Once you install and open the app for first time the app would ask for permission to use your location
 to give you suggestions about places around you. Point your phone at different directions to see what places 
 are in that direction.
 
 Requires iOS 9 and iPhone (Will run on simulator but no location updates on a simulator. Although you can specify a location)
